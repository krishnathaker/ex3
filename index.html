  <h1>Van Gogh's The Starry Night </h1>

  <p id="mainP"> My most favorite piece of art is The Starry Night. The Starry Night is one of Vincent Van Gogh's finest oil canvas paintings. </p>
  <p> Van Gogh was a popular post-impressionist artist. He created this painting in June of 1889. The painting depicts the view from the east-facing window of Van Gogh's asylum room at Saint-Remy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an idealist
    village.</p>
  <p> This painting has been a part of the permanent collection at the Museaum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, since 1941. </p>
  <p> I enjoy this painting because I find the different shades of blue very soothing. I also like the small-stroke method of painting that Van Gogh used to depict the stars and moon. </p>
