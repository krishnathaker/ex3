  <h1>Paul Cezanne's Chateau Noir </h1>

  <p id="mainP" class="P1"> Chateau Noir, which is 'Black House/Manor' in French, is a famous post-impressionist oil painting made by Paul Cezanne, a French artist. </p>
  <p class="P1"> An old country house by the name of Chateau Noir stood on the hillside near the Bibemus quarry. Cézanne began to paint in the area around 1900, finding numerous motifs in the dense woods on the grounds of the estate, for example: Trees and Rocks in
    the Park of the Château Noir, c. 1904. The house, in its decrepit isolation, inspired some of the artist’s most foreboding images. The eerie structure seen in Château Noir, 1900–1904, seemingly in ruins, is half-hidden behind pines that, like the
    rocks of Bibémus, almost obstruct the sky. Cézanne’s saturated palette—dark greens, blues and ochers—makes the scene all the more powerful.</p>
  <p class="P1"> I like this painting due to the simple and limited use of colors, which somehow managed to create a complex and beautiful landscape in front of my eyes. I enjoy photography, and I think that the artist has done a great job of creating a clear image
    of Chateau Noir in my mind. I hope to visit this place someday and capture it in my camera. </p>
