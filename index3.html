  <h1>Edgar Degas' Dancers in Pink </h1>

  <p id="mainP" class="P1"> Dancers in Pink in my most favorite painting by Edgar Degas. Edgar Degas was a French impressionist artist whose paintings largely included ballerinas as the subject. </p>
  <p class="P1">In most of his paintings including this one, you will notice that the characters in the painting never directly address the viewer. In this painting, he weights the composition towards the right side with the four principal subjects, but he portrays
    two of them to be gazing in the left, which then draws viewers' eyes to the left side of the painting. </p>
  <p class="P1"> I enjoy most of Degas' work since they contain such a flow that allows me to properly view the painting and mentally visualize the entire scene. The colors he chooses to use are a nice contrast of dull and bright, that really liven up his paintings.</p>
